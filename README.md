## Node.js: JavaScript Beyond the Browser

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side applications and script automation tools.

This README provides a brief overview of Node.js, its features, and resources for getting started.

### Features

* **JavaScript Everywhere:**  Write server-side applications in JavaScript, the language you already know from web development.
* **Event-Driven Architecture:**  Node.js excels at handling asynchronous requests efficiently, making it ideal for real-time applications and I/O-bound tasks.
* **Package Ecosystem:**  Benefit from a vast and active open-source community with a rich ecosystem of pre-built modules (npm packages) for various functionalities.
* **Performance:**  Node.js is known for its fast execution speed due to its V8 engine and non-blocking I/O model.
